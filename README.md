# Backend Demystified!
🎯 I couldn't find a comprehensive repo that demonstrates backend concepts like HTTP, UDP, TCP, request-response and other networking concepts so I decided to build one myself. This project brings together the various networking concepts I have learnt — perfect for learning, experimenting, or kickstarting my backend journey. 
✨ Really looking forward to loads of learning!
