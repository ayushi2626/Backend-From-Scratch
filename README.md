# Backend Concepts Spring-Booted!
ðŸŽ¯ I couldn't find a comprehensive Spring Boot example that demonstrates request-response handling across HTTP, TCP, UDP and other networking concepts so I decided to build one myself. This project brings together the various networking concepts I have learnt in a clean, modular Spring Boot setup â€” perfect for learning, experimenting, or kickstarting my backend journey. 
âœ¨ Really looking forward to loads of learning!
